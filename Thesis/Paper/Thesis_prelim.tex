We investigate the flow transitions in sheared annular electroconvection using {matrix-free} numerical bifurcation methods. In particular, we study a model that simulates a liquid crystal film in the Smectic~A phase suspended between two annular electrodes, and subjected to an electric potential difference and a shear applied by rotating the inner anode at a constant rate.
Due to the Smectic A nature of the liquid crystal, the fluid can be considered two-dimensional and is modelled using the 2-D incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations coupled with an equation for charge continuity. The charge density and the electric potential are coupled using a nonlocal relation given by Maxwell's equations.

%In this thesis, dynamical system approach is used to identify the transition of the flow, by implementing numerical bifurcation methods.
In this thesis, a {matrix-free} numerical bifurcation method is implemented to identify the transitions of the flow that result due to changes in the main nondimensional control parameter, the Rayleigh number $\mathcal{R}$, which is proportional to the square of the applied voltage. %Upon increasing $\mathcal{R}$, the flow undergoes successive transitions from the axisymmetric base state, to rotating waves, to amplitude vacillating waves. %A pseudo-spectral method has been implemented in MATLAB that numerically integrates perturbations from the base state.Rayleigh number $\mathcal{R}$.
This method consists of a natural continuation method that computes the axisymmetric and rotating waves state by detecting fixed points of two different discrete-time dynamical systems based on numerical integration, and a linear stability analysis that identifies the local behaviour of the flow.
%In the numerical bifurcation method, the Jacobian of the nonlinear system is approximated using finite differences. This leads to the use of matrix-free methods to solve the linear system obtained at every Newton iteration as well as the eigenvalue problem.Due to the $SO(2)$ symmetry of the system, a different approach is implemented to compute the rotating wave state. The techniques of implementation are presented and the results are summarized in a bifurcation diagram where the primary and secondary transitions are captured.
The nature of the rotating waves is used to simplify the computation of their corresponding solutions.
The primary transition from axisymmetric flow to rotating waves, and the secondary transition from rotating waves to amplitude vacillation are isolated. The results are consistent with previous experimental results and numerical simulations, and are summarized in a numerically computed bifurcation diagram.
